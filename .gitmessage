# Type should be one of the following:
# * feat: A new feature
# * fix: A bug fix
# * docs: Documentation only changes
# * style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
# * refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# * perf: A code change that improves performance
# * test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
# * build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
# * ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
# * chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
#
# Scope is optional and should be the name of the package affected
#
# Subject should use imperative mood and not be capitalized
#
# Body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this
# with previous behavior
#
# Footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also
# the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit Closes
#
# Breaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space
# or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
#
# Examples:
# feat(webview): add support for custom CSS injection
# fix(bridge): resolve memory leak in bridge communication
